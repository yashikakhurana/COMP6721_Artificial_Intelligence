Datasets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) In the AI dataset, we included around 100 images for each of the classes in separate 
   sub-folders such as "with_mask", "without_mask", "not_a_person".

b) The google drive link to the complete dataset folder which we are using in the project:

   is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gqOxDVpGI6gsMtvj0l7yPN_4VzY1qJ5c?usp=sharing

c) The dataset can also be found in the GitHub respository 

   https://github.com/NikithaBangera/COMP6721_Artificial_Intelligence

Running the code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) The code is written in jupyter notebook where the codes are organized and well 
documented in each cells. 

b) The code needs to be executed by running each cell sequentially. Please make
Sure to wait for above code to be executed completely before moving to the next
cell (which includes all train, testing and evaluation code in one single notebook
Named Project_Part_1.ipynb but arranged in different cells)

c)Python version used - 3.6
